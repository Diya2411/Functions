        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "Answer- Python is a popular programming language that's used for many tasks, including web development, data science, and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Python is popular because it is easy to learn, versatile, and has strong community support. It offers extensive libraries, works across platforms, and is widely used in web development, data science, AI, automation, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "Answer- An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line instead of compiling it all at once. It translates high-level Python code into machine-readable instructions during runtime, making debugging easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Python keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings that you cannot use as variable names or identifiers; examples include if, else, for, while, def, and import.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "Answer- No, we cannot use keywords as variable names in most programming languages because keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings used for language syntax and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "Answer- In Python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be changed after its creation. Mutable objects, like lists, dictionaries, and sets, can be modified in place.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "Answer- 1. Lists(Mutable)-\n",
        "-> Mutability means an object can be changed after it i created.\n",
        "-> Lists are mutable, meaning we can modify them by adding, removing, or changing elements.\n",
        "Example- my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list[0] = 10  # Changing an element\n",
        "my_list.append(4)  # Adding an element\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Tuples(Immutable)-\n",
        "-> Immutability means an object cannot be changed after it is created.\n",
        "Tuples are immutable, so once we create a tuple, we cannot modify its elements.\n",
        "Example- my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "my_tuple[0] = 10  # ❌ This will give an error: TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "Answer- In Python, \"==\" checks for value equality (whether two objects have the same value), while \"is\" checks for object identity (whether two variables point to the same object in memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Logical operators in Python combine two or more operands and conduct logical comparisons on them. There are three types, i.e., AND, OR, and NOT. They return a boolean value, i.e., True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one data type into another.\n",
        "Example: you want to change the data type of a variable from an integer 2 to a float 2.0. This is a case where you'd use type casting.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "Answer- Implicit type casting happens automatically by the compiler, converting a value from one type to another.\n",
        "-> While explicit type casting requires the programmer to use a special syntax to perform the conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "Answer- Conditional statements in Python, like if, elif, and else, allow us to control the flow of your program by executing different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false, enabling dynamic and responsive programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "Answer- The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions.\n",
        "-> For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "Answer- The main difference between for and while loops is that \"for loops\" are used when we know the number of iterations beforehand, while \"while loops\" are used when the number of iterations depends on a condition that may or may not be met.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "Answer- In programming, for loops are best used when we know the number of iterations ahead of time, whereas a while loop is best used when we don't know the number of iterations in advance. Both methods can help us iterate through our code.\n",
